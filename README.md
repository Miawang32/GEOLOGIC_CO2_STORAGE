# GEOLOGIC_CO2_STORAGE

> **A MATLAB-based workflow for geological COâ‚‚ storage modelling, history matching, optimisation, and risk assessment.**

## âœ¨ Project Overview
Geologic storage of carbon dioxide (GCS) is recognised as a key technology for large-scale decarbonisation.  
This repository provides a modular MATLAB implementation (100 % MATLAB) that wraps and extends the **MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST)** carbon-storage functionality â€” including history matching (Model Updating), design optimisation, and quantitative risk assessment â€” for rapid scenario studies and research prototyping. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
