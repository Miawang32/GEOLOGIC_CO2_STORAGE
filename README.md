# 🌍 CO₂ Geologic Storage Simulation & Risk Assessment  
**PTE-412/464 Final Project – University of Southern California**

This repository presents a comprehensive simulation study of geologic CO₂ storage, completed as the final project for the PTE-412/464 course "Modeling, Simulation, and Management of Subsurface Flow Systems", instructed by Prof. Behnam Jafarpour at USC.

We simulate the injection, monitoring, and optimization of CO₂ storage in a synthetic reservoir under geological uncertainty, evaluate leakage and fracturing risks, and perform model updating with observation data.

## 🔍 Project Tasks

### 1. Risk Assessment
- Simulated 20 permeability realizations for a 15-layer reservoir using Monte Carlo sampling.
- Evaluated CO₂ plume migration, pressure build-up, and storage distribution.
- Quantified risks of:
  - **Leakage**: via CO₂ volume in top layer.
  - **Fracturing**: via max pore pressure.

### 2. Model Updating
- Compared simulated data with synthetic field measurements from injection/observation wells.
- Identified best-matching realization.
- Updated permeability multipliers to improve history match.

### 3. Optimization (Optional for Extension)
- Well placement and injection rate adjustment to minimize leakage and fracturing simultaneously.
